bugs:
unicode doesnt show up on some devices
hand calculator hard to use/doesn't work on mobile
dragging a card on top of itself (or other cards in any zone) copies the card, not cuts it

note:
test locally on edge to get around CORS policy requirements

todo:
easy:
split into multiple js files?
drag card off of hand calc to remove it

harder:
let them actually draw the cards and play through the round?
