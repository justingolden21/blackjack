bugs:
unicode doesnt show up on some devices
hand calculator hard to use/doesn't work on mobile
dragging a card on top of itself (or other cards in any zone) copies the card, not cuts it

note:
test locally on edge to get around CORS policy requirements

todo:
easy:
split into multiple js files?
drag card off of hand calc to remove it

organize css colors with comments or sass

harder:
let them actually draw the cards and play through the round?

animate dealing cards to player and dealer?

store cookies for streaks/stats option
add sharethis?

icon on next hand button with hand of cards
icons next to hit, stand, etc buttons
remove keyboard shortcut info on mobile (css display none @media)
graphical representation of bar filled left or right red or green for odds if checkbox is shown


3 checkboxes for which possible hands to display:
hard, soft, pairs

display close cases only

maybe: fix ui for enter hand for dealer?

option to play rest of hand (no chips)



possible redundant code in calc hand btn listener and getCorrectOption function

split js into 2 or 3 files. possible new files include calcHand modal code and drag and drop stuff


make calc hand modal work with touch screen and with keyboard


todo

todo: checkbox not ugly, like songsearcher using fontawesome
todo: bargraph for odds?
todo: display only difficult cases

later: basic rules of blackjack explained modal. like wiki
later: cheatcard modal. highlight your hand in cheatcard. like bottom of this: https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/appendix/1/
later: odds on each hand modal. highlight hand in table. like this: https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/appendix/1/
later: enter your hand and dealer's and show odds modal. like this: https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/hand-calculator/

import and export stats to .txt


maybe edit house rule settings, show stats on percentage corrct and streak
maybe: share that i stood on hard 13 against dealer 6 and got it right and only 23.7% of people did. check out blackjack sim HERE
