BUGS
========
unicode doesnt show up on some devices
dragging a card on top of itself (or other cards in any zone) copies the card, not cuts it

========
TODO
========
Easy:
add progress bar display to hand calc
remove keyboard shortcut info on mobile (css display none @media)

Medium:
option for close case hands only "close cases"
fix checkbox.js for focusing checkboxes...
get rid of calc hand btn (does it automatically, adds confusion). currently calcs by clicking btn, so need to change that first

Hard:
animate dealing cards to player and dealer. make animation a checkbox/option
option to play rest of hand (no chips, draw the cards)

========
MAYBE
========
option to edit house rule settings, like double after split, surrender, number of decks, etc
share/promo idea: share that i stood on hard 13 against dealer 6 and got it right and only 23.7% of people did. check out blackjack sim HERE
more stats on percentages like percentages on hard, soft, split hands, in a new stats modal, maybe even a graph vs time of accuracy
get a custom url
import and export stats to .txt
drag card off of hand calc to remove it
store cookies for streaks/stats option
add sharethis
make calc hand modal work with keyboard
change the hand calc UI to just 2 drop downs for player and dealer...

OPTIONS:
display percentage accuracy on bottom
display soft hands in table as A7 instead of 18
add more info to alert about if you're correct, info for when you do what with that hand

MODALS:

how to play:
	basic rules, like wiki. get to 21 without bust, etc

how to count:
	simple hi-lo counting
	2-6 is +1, 7-9 is 0, 10,j,q,k and ace is -1
	higher numbers are better for you
	this is running count
	true count is running count divided by decks remaining

advantage:
	with only basic strategy table, you are at -0.5%
	with never bust, you are -4%
	for each true count, you gain about +0.5%

betting units:
	a betting unit is the minimum or normal amount you would bet
	a good betting unit is 1/1000 of your bankroll, to minimize the odds of running out
	your maximum bet is suggested to be about 4-6 times your minimum
	the higher the maximum, the mroe you can make, but the more risk
	never bet over 1/4 of your money available so you can split and double
	for each +1 true count over 0, bet +1 betting unit.
	in other words, subtract 1 from your true count and multiply by your betting unit to determine what to bet
	also, link to advantage calculator
	also add link to https://www.instructables.com/id/Card-Counting-and-Ranging-Bet-Sizes/

add disclaimer to info modal that we are not responsible if you lose money, blackjack is inherintly random
