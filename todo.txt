BUGS
========
unicode doesnt show up on some devices
dragging a card on top of itself (or other cards in any zone) copies the card, not cuts it

========
TODO
========
Easy:
update strategy card img (again...)
fullscreen button

Medium:
fix close btn in modal manually with css
fix for huge screens
option for close case hands only "close cases"
make checkbox.js its own repo, then have songssearcher, blackjack, etc link to that script, update that script when it needs updating
fix checkbox.js for focusing checkboxes...
more specific options on which hands to generate? enter specific hands you want included or exluded? display buttons that say quiz me on this more or less? have options for forgetting ones youve got correct, or got correct twice, or twice in a row? drop down menu for threshhold? cookies for stats?
option to quiz only on a certain player hand
button to print strategy table

Hard/Pain:
animate dealing cards to player and dealer
option to play rest of hand (no chips, draw the cards)

Ugh:
Make it a dynamic website, store data on which hands users choose which options, display stats and use it as catalyst for sharing/marketing

========
MAYBE
========
insights like "you hit too often" etc...? option?
graph of chips going up and down? eh...
if ?q=strategy is in url, then open that modal on load?
option to edit house rule settings, like double after split, surrender, number of decks, etc
share/promo idea: share that i stood on hard 13 against dealer 6 and got it right and only 23.7% of people did. check out blackjack sim HERE
more stats on percentages like percentages on hard, soft, split hands, in a new stats modal, maybe even a graph time vs accuracy
get a custom url
import and export stats to .txt
drag card off of hand calc to remove it
store cookies for streaks/stats and options/settings (and numChips :) )
add sharethis
make calc hand modal work with keyboard
change the hand calc UI to just 2 drop downs for player and dealer...
larger modals (manually decrease margin/padding)
add to about modal about each of the other modals and how to use them (or add that info to the bottom of those modals)

OPTIONS:
display percentage accuracy on bottom
display soft hands in table as A7 instead of 18
add more info to alert about if you're correct, info for when you do what with that hand
option to display the sliver of the table for your hand?

MODALS:

later: cheatcard modal. highlight your hand in cheatcard. like bottom of this: https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/appendix/1/
later: odds on each hand modal. highlight hand in table. like this: https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/appendix/1/
later: enter your hand and dealer's and show odds modal. like this: https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/hand-calculator/

how to play:
	basic rules, like wiki. get to 21 without bust, etc

how to count:
	simple hi-lo counting
	2-6 is +1, 7-9 is 0, 10,j,q,k and ace is -1
	higher numbers are better for you
	this is running count
	true count is running count divided by decks remaining

advantage:
	with only basic strategy table, you are at -0.5%
	with never bust, you are -4%
	for each true count, you gain about +0.5%

betting units:
	a betting unit is the minimum or normal amount you would bet
	a good betting unit is 1/1000 of your bankroll, to minimize the odds of running out
	your maximum bet is suggested to be about 4-6 times your minimum
	the higher the maximum, the mroe you can make, but the more risk
	never bet over 1/4 of your money available so you can split and double
	for each +1 true count over 0, bet +1 betting unit.
	in other words, subtract 1 from your true count and multiply by your betting unit to determine what to bet
	also, link to advantage calculator
	also add link to https://www.instructables.com/id/Card-Counting-and-Ranging-Bet-Sizes/

add disclaimer to info modal that we are not responsible if you lose money, blackjack is inherintly random

DOMAIN NAME IDEAS:
play blackjack now
the blackjack sim
bj practice

CLEAN:
possible redundant code in calc hand btn listener and getCorrectOption function
make another js file
organize css colors with comments
change css to scss
organize file structure

OTHER APPLICATIONS:
make it a phone app
make it a pwa, and a chrome web app
make a seperate thing for just a strategy table
make a seperate thing for a full simulator, with no other features just playing
make a seperate thing for card counting help and practice/sim
