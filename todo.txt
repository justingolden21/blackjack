bugs:
unicode doesnt show up on some devices
hand calculator hard to use/doesn't work on mobile

todo:
easy:
split into multiple js files?
make checkboxes less ugly
drag card off of hand calc to remove it

harder:
let them actually draw the cards and play through the round?



icon on next hand button with hand of cards
remove keyboard shortcut info on mobile (css display none @media)
graphical representation of bar filled left or right red or green for odds if checkbox is shown
