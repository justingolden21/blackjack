BUGS
========
unicode doesnt show up on some devices
dragging a card on top of itself (or other cards in any zone) copies the card, not cuts it

========
TODO
========
easy:
split into multiple js files?
drag card off of hand calc to remove it

organize css colors with comments or sass

harder:
let them actually draw the cards and play through the round?

animate dealing cards to player and dealer?

store cookies for streaks/stats option
add sharethis?

icon on next hand button with hand of cards
icons next to hit, stand, etc buttons
remove keyboard shortcut info on mobile (css display none @media)
graphical representation of bar filled left or right red or green for odds if checkbox is shown


3 checkboxes for which possible hands to display:
hard, soft, pairs

display close cases only

option to play rest of hand (no chips)



possible redundant code in calc hand btn listener and getCorrectOption function

split js into 2 or 3 files. possible new files include calcHand modal code and drag and drop stuff

optional/maybe:
make calc hand modal work with keyboard
change the hand calc UI to just 2 drop downs for player and dealer...

split css into multiple files?

fix file structure/organize

get rid of calc hand btn (does it automatically, adds confusion). currently calcs by clicking btn, so need to change that first

fix checkbox.js for focusing checkboxes...

update cheatsheet img for download

add progress bar display to hand calc

MODALS:
how to play:
	basic rules. get to 21 without bust, etc

how to count:
	simple hi-lo counting
	2-6 is +1, 7-9 is 0, 10,j,q,k and ace is -1
	higher numbers are better for you
	this is running count
	true count is running count divided by decks remaining

advantage:
	with only basic strategy table, you are at -0.5%
	with never bust, you are -4%
	for each true count, you gain about +0.5%

betting units:
	a betting unit is the minimum or normal amount you would bet
	a good betting unit is 1/1000 of your bankroll, to minimize the odds of running out
	your maximum bet is suggested to be about 4-6 times your minimum
	the higher the maximum, the mroe you can make, but the more risk
	never bet over 1/4 of your money available so you can split and double
	for each +1 true count over 0, bet +1 betting unit.
	in other words, subtract 1 from your true count and multiply by your betting unit to determine what to bet
	also, link to advantage calculator
	also add link to https://www.instructables.com/id/Card-Counting-and-Ranging-Bet-Sizes/

add disclaimer to info modal that we are not responsible if you lose money, blackjack is inherintly random


OTHER APPLICATIONS:
make it a phone app
make a seperate thing for just a strategy table
make a seperate thing for a full simulator, with no other features just playing
make a seperate thing for card counting help and practice/sim
